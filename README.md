# XOBotRipper
  
 Just edit the variables labeled "username" & "password" with any registered XOBot username & password.
 
 Changed the variable "outputDir" to where you want the shit dumped too.
 
 If ripping scripts, make sure you have the scripts added to the account via the SDN, or else it has nothing to rip.
 
 If trying to rip a VIP script/server, make sure the account has VIP access.
 
 They'll probably push a quick fix to block this, and I'll probably be to lazy to fix.
